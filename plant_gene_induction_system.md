1. [A glucocorticoid‐mediated transcriptional induction system in transgenic plants](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1997.11030605.x). Plant Journal, 1997. This is the first paper described the GR induction system in plant. It has been widely used in Arabidopsis and be modified to other plants too. It has **993** citations according to Google Scholar.

	+ An application of this technique quickly after it publised is: [Glucocorticoid-inducible expression of a bacterial avirulence gene in transgenic ARABIDOPSIS INDUCES Hypersensitive cell death](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1998.00106.x). The figure 1 in that paper explains how the system works. In their case, the *avrRpt2* avirulence gene is conditionally induced.

	+ Dr Jean Greenberg lab further modified this vector to Gateway compatible. The vectors are described in the [The type III effector repertoire of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B728a and its role in survival and disease on host and non‐host plants](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05350.x).
